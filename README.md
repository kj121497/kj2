# A Usability Testing of Instagram

### Purpose of Usability Testing
The purpose of this usability testing of Instagram is to gauge how easy it is and how well users can navigate the app in question. Users should enjoy their experience on the app and find it relatively easy to use, considering how popular and technologically advanced Instagram appears to be. With this UT, hopefully Instagram can improve its current features. Specifically, the UT will record if a user can find the feature: “Post’s You’ve Liked”—also, if they can access the feature to view a post they have Liked. Then, the UT will note if a user can comfortably and accessibly watch a video; they will be asked to play, pause, forward, rewind, and find a time marker. Furthermore, the UT will measure Instagram’s uploading and posting capabilities. Lastly, the usability testing will reveal if a user can access the features mentioned above and if they can, find out how long it takes them to complete the task.

### Information Learned from Pilot Test

From the usability testing, I was able to learn how difficult it was for the user to access the features requesting to be found in the tasks. For example, the user was unable to find “Post You’ve Liked” and could not complete the next step in task number one, which was to directly access a Liked post. I realized how important it is for the feature to be more accessible to inexperienced and experienced users alike. Moreover, I learned it is important for the user to know of a time marker, which he was unable to find, even though it is possible to view (very briefly in the beginning). This proves the time marker should be viewable throughout the entire video. Also, I learned the user found the app ‘unprofessional’ and ‘intimidating’. While ‘intimidating’ did not surprise me, unprofessional’ did, which means the app should improve for users to navigate more easily. As for what went well, the user spoke his mind and let me know what he was thinking as he performed tasks. Also, he attempted the tasks again and again, refusing to give up after one try. As for what did not go well, sometimes I had to clarify a task or a question. Also, there was a repeat question on the test, which we ignored. If I could improve the UT in the future, I would like to have clear questions and thoroughly revise the form before asking a participator to fill it.
